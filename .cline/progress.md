# Progress: tts-mcp

## Current Status
tts-mcp is a **fully functional** text-to-speech solution with two primary components:
1. A CLI utility for converting text to speech files
2. An MCP server for real-time text-to-speech integration with Claude Desktop

The project is in a **production-ready state** with all core features implemented and working properly.
